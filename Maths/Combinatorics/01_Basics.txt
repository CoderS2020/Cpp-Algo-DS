//1.nCr= n!/(n-r)! . r!
nCr=nCn-r
nCr=(n-1)C(r-1) + (n-1)nCr
(x+y)^n=nC0 x^0y^n + nC1x^1y^n-1 +nC2x^2y^n-2 + ....+ nCn x^ny^0

//2.
Say you have a grid with lower left starting from (0,0) to (x,y)
and you have 2 options on every grid - right or up.
You can try on paper- at the end the no of ups will always be equal to y and no of rights will be equal to x (total x+y)
So the answer is (x+y)Cx or (x+y)Cy

Same for upper left to lower right

//3.
n coins flip
probablity that m is heads
nCm/2^n

//4. 
Pascal Triangle / Recurrence Formula
nCr=(n-1)C(r-1) + (n-1)nCr

//5.
nC0+nC1+nC2+...=2^n
Even terms = odd terms
ie nC0+nC2+nC4+..=nC1+nC3+nC5.. = (2^n)/2 =2^n-1

//Q Find no of intersection pts of diagonals in a polygon of n vertices 

Ans 1. For all vertices find their connections and then from this subtract edges = nC2 - n 
(from n points choose 2 pts to form connection - connection which forms edge of polygon but not diagonal)

Ans 2. For a vertex its adjacent 2 vertices will always form an edge but never a diagonal
but leaving these 2 adjacent vertices rest all vertices will form a diagonal so n * (n-3) [2 adjacent and 1 self]
But when we consider for all edges then all diagonals will be counted twice hence divide it by two (a->b and b->a)
hence final answer =n*(n-3)/2

//Q Find no of intersection pts of diagonals in a polygon of n vertices given no three diagonals
intersect in a polygon

Ans] nC4
Bcz intersection is formed only when 4 vertices are taken in consideration


//Efficient Summations
Q) C(n,0) + C(n+1,1) + C(n+2,2)... C(n+k,k)
so sum is (n+k+1)C(k)

Q) sum(C(n,i)*C(m,k-i)) over i in [0,k]
Ans) So we can imagine 2 buckets, from one we choose nCi and other bucket mCk-i
     So we can combine n+mCk [i+k-i=k and n+m]
