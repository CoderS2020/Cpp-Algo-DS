/*
DP= recursion + storage

Write recursive solution and then you can either use memoization or top-down approach
To identify DP problems you have to check two parameters
a) Is any choice given
b) Have they asked optimal answer (max,min, etc)

For finding base conditions think of the smallest valid 'inputs'
