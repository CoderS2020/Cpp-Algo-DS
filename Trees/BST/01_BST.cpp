Everything in left of the node should be smaller and everything on the right should be larger.
Left subtree and right subtree should be BST.
Sometimes duplicates are allowed and to consider that we place it to the left of the duplicate node.
Or we can count the frequency of nodes.
Height of BST is generally logn (base 2)
