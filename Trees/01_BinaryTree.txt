1) Full Binary Tree: Has either 0 or 2 children
2) Complete Binary Tree: a) All levels are completely filled except the last levels 
                         b) The last level has all nodes as left as possible
3) Perfect Binary Tree: all leaf nodes are at same level
4) Balanced Binary Tree: height of tree at max log(n) [n-> no of node]
5) Degenerate Tree: Every node has a single child
