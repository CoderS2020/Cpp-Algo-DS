If you are given 3 different graphs ,
never say that they are independent unless it is mentioned in the question.
Instead always say that this is a disconnected graph with 3 components(number can be any)

Even a single node can be called as a component

Always write code for multiple components irrespective whether it is DFS or BFS

Take a visitedArray and initialize it to 0
for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){
    if(!visitedArray[i]){ //check if the node is not visited
        write code for DFS or BFS
    }
}


To find the number of components count the no of times your code gets inside the if statement
